/**
    The pending-program handshake does no heap work under its lock.

    **VST3 delivers a program change as an automatable parameter, so this path can arrive on the
    AUDIO THREAD.** It used to do two `juce::String` assignments inside `pendingLock`. A String copy
    is a refcount increment and reads as safe; the assignment is the other half, releasing whatever
    the target held first — and a refcount reaching zero calls `free()`.

    **The case was never dropout risk.** Measured at 0.12 us worst case against a 10,667 us block
    budget, it is negligible — because a refcount release happens to be cheap, not because anything
    guarantees the path stays heap-free. The argument is that a path the audio thread can reach does
    heap work at all, and that the next person to add a field to `ProgramId` has no reason to know.

    **Why this test arms the sentinel around these two functions and not around
    `requestProgramChange`.** An allocation sentinel counts allocations and frees; it is not
    lock-aware. The copy and the release still happen — they happen in the CALLER's frame now — so a
    probe around the whole call reports the same totals before and after the change. Only a probe
    around the locked region itself can see the difference, and these functions are that region.

            `AllocationSentinel`'s counters include a different population on each platform, so the
            same number means three things. On glibc Linux an incidental allocation inside libc that
            lands in the armed window is counted and is not a defect — measured, and it made these
            rows fail with 3 alloc (64 bytes), then 1 alloc (16 bytes), then pass 20 of 20, which
            reads as a flaky test. On Windows `malloc` is not counted at all.

            So the rows are REPORTED everywhere and asserted where they can carry a verdict, and the
            log says which. Same shape as the CPU bar, which asserts only on the machine that
            recorded its baseline. */
