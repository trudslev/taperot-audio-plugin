/**
    **The name being typed must be visible, and its caret must blink.**

    Both halves shipped broken in v1.0.0-rc.1 and both were reported from a real panel on
    2026-08-30, by a person naming a Program. Six green suites and a three-platform CI matrix
    missed them, because nothing anywhere asserted that naming mode renders anything at all.

      * TapeRot drew the CURRENT Program's name in the field while the caption above it read
        NAME PROGRAM. Keystrokes were recorded and rendered nowhere, so the field looked dead and
        a second SAVE press committed an empty name as `TAKE n`.
      * CHORUS-60 drew the caret into a cached image whose key holds what varies - bank, name,
        modified, naming state, typed text, menu, readout - and a clock phase is not among them.
        The layer was rebuilt on entering naming and on each keystroke and never between, so the
        caret appeared about half the time on entry and never blinked.

    **Why this samples over a period rather than comparing two renders.** The blink is 1 s at
    50 percent duty off the wall clock, which a test cannot set. Two shots 500 ms apart can land on
    the same phase if the sleep drifts across a boundary; five shots spanning 1.2 s cannot all miss.
    The assertion is that at least two of them DIFFER, which is exactly the property that was absent
    - a frozen caret gives five identical images no matter when they are taken.

    What this cannot see is what `renderComponent` cannot see: focus, the cursor the window server
    owns, z-order. It asserts that the panel's own pixels change, which is the half that broke.
