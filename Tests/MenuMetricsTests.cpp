/**
    The Program list's caption is sized from its own type, never from the row.

    **The number is not the thing being guarded — the construction is.** This panel's caption comes
    out 19, the same as Elmer's, and that is a coincidence: Share Tech Mono's line box is 1.127 em
    against IBM Plex Mono's 1.300, and 11px of one plus 9px of the other happen to meet once the
    3/4 padding is added. So the test asserts the construction reproduces, and asserts the
    relationship that the ruling is actually about, rather than pinning a literal that would go
    stale the moment the caption type changed.
