/*  Category 7: what this casting costs, against a figure that is a FILE.

    **The baseline is `Tests/cpu-baseline.json`, committed, and a missing one is a REFUSAL.** A check
    that silently does nothing when its input is absent is indistinguishable from a check that
    passed, and this suite has three recorded cases of exactly that.

    **Re-baselining is an explicit, committed act.** Set `NF_WRITE_CPU_BASELINE=1` in the
    environment and the run writes the file instead of asserting against it. That is deliberately
    awkward: a figure must never be quietly moved to make a regression go away, and the provenance
    the file records — machine, OS, config, the core commit every casting was pinned at — is what
    makes *one sitting, all six, one machine state* enforceable after the fact rather than a promise.

    **What this replaces.** `CPUCheckTests.cpp` asserted only *average block time < real-time budget* at a
    single 48 k / 64 configuration — a bar a plugin passes at 99 % of a core, which says nothing
    about how many instances will fit. It is superseded rather than kept.
