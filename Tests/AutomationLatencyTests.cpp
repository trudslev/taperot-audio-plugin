/**
    Category 5 — automation and latency.

    ## The declared-latency check, and the known case it is introduced against

    Five of the six castings declare no latency at all. **A declaration of zero is a claim like any
    other**, and the only one of the six that can validate the instrument is TapeRot: it is the sole
    casting that declares any (`setLatencySamples (saturator.getLatencySamples())`), its Saturator
    oversamples, and category 4 independently measured a ~20 ms dead window at the start of every
    render which is that latency showing up in a level profile.

    So TapeRot is the known case, stated before the set is run: **the instrument must report a
    non-zero figure there and it must agree with `getLatencySamples()`.** If it reports zero for
    TapeRot, a zero anywhere else means nothing — which is the failure mode five "no latency" claims
    would otherwise sail through.

    ## What agreement means

    An impulse must emerge at exactly the declared latency. Emerging LATER than declared is undeclared
    delay — a host aligns by the declaration, so the plugin's output arrives late and every other
    track is early against it. Emerging EARLIER is a declaration that over-compensates, which pulls
    the plugin ahead. Both are reported; neither is assumed to be the interesting one.
